"""
  This is the implementation of ASVspoof2017 Competition database high level interface that can be used in
  `bob.bio.base` framework. IMPORTANT: this interface is not suitable for running the verification experiments,
  since ASVspoof2017 does not have verification protocols. This interface is just a simple wrapper around
  presentation attack detection protocols, providing data for `licit` (real access) and `spoof` (attacks) scenarios,
  so that training scripts provided by `bob.bio.base` can be run on this database.
  Also, this is an extension of a FileList based database interface.
